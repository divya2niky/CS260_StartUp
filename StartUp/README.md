Simon HTML project assignment:

Startup Project notes:

I have leared so many new things while working on this project. While I refered to the Simon assignment but I relied a lot on google to get some tips and tricks to get a good portfolio. 
I refered to so many professional portfolios. I tried to design my portfolio looking into those professional portfolios. 
My first learning was :
1. Using ::before,::after that allows me to insert contet onto a page without it needing to be in the HTML.
2. Putting all the colors by giving a name for each color in a different file.This helped me to take colors from that file instead of giving numbers. 
3. I have learned how I can used the margin top and margin bottom for the dimensions.
5. I learned to use how to use the hover button for my "Hire Me" button. 
6. I learned to use "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.3.0/css/all.min.css" for my stylesheets. I learned how to code icons for my side bars.
4. I learned how to breakdown my page as per design. It was a lot but a learning experiance on how I can work on small things and to get big picture. 

Simon JS project assignment:
One interesting thing I learned is that JS cuts down on time that is needed ofr the compilation like Java. The important learning I had was doing the login. It was pretty simple and easy to understand. Another one was how to use async, functions, constructors on the website.
