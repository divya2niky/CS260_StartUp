Simon HTML project assignment:
I learned how to use basic HTML elements for structure,input, output, drawing and for hyperlink.


Simon CSS project assignment notes:
I learned how to make my application visually appealing by adding user interface elements using CSS framework.



Startup Project notes:

I have leared so many new things while working on this project. While I refered to the Simon assignment but I relied a lot on google to get some tips and tricks to get a good portfolio. 
I refered to so many professional portfolios. I tried to design my portfolio looking into those professional portfolios. 
My first learning was :
1. Using ::before,::after that allows me to insert contet onto a page without it needing to be in the HTML.
2. Putting all the colors by giving a name for each color in a different file.This helped me to take colors from that file instead of giving numbers. 
3. I have learned how I can used the margin top and margin bottom for the dimensions.
5. I learned to use how to use the hover button for my "Hire Me" button. 
6. I learned to use "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.3.0/css/all.min.css" for my stylesheets. I learned how to code icons for my side bars.
4. I learned how to breakdown my page as per design. It was a lot but a learning experiance on how I can work on small things and to get big picture. 

Simon JS project assignment:
One interesting thing I learned is that JS cuts down on time that is needed ofr the compilation like Java. The important learning I had was doing the login. It was pretty simple and easy to understand. Another one was how to use async, functions, constructors on the website. 


Startup Project notes:

My first learning for this assignment is to have patience. While I had so many ideas to implement in my portfolio, I had to choose the things that makes my project work better.
1. I struggled with JS functions in this project.I got a good practice on addEventListener() for switching the colors in the portfolio.
2. Making sure I name my classes that make sense. Which eventually helped to style the class and use it in JS. 
3. This time I used the "inspect" option on the website to make changes idententations. That was pretty cool.
4. I learned that I can hide style switcher on scroll. Which means when I click the settings button, the colors pop out and when I scroll down the page the colors pop hides. I was able to do this using window.addEventListener() 
5. I learned that document and window are different objects and they some different events. Using addEventListener() on them listens to events destined for a different object. Like, there is a "resize" event on the window object that is not on the document object. 
6.
