Simon HTML project assignment:
I learned how to use basic HTML elements for structure,input, output, drawing and for hyperlink.


Simon CSS project assignment notes:
I learned how to make my application visually appealing by adding user interface elements using CSS framework.



Startup Project notes:

I have leared so many new things while working on this project. While I refered to the Simon assignment but I relied a lot on google to get some tips and tricks to get a good portfolio. 
I refered to so many professional portfolios. I tried to design my portfolio looking into those professional portfolios. 
My first learning was :
1. Using ::before,::after that allows me to insert contet onto a page without it needing to be in the HTML.
2. Putting all the colors by giving a name for each color in a different file.This helped me to take colors from that file instead of giving numbers. 
3. I have learned how I can used the margin top and margin bottom for the dimensions.
5. I learned to use how to use the hover button for my "Hire Me" button. 
6. I learned to use "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.3.0/css/all.min.css" for my stylesheets. I learned how to code icons for my side bars.
4. I learned how to breakdown my page as per design. It was a lot but a learning experiance on how I can work on small things and to get big picture. 

Simon JS project assignment:
One interesting thing I learned is that JS cuts down on time that is needed ofr the compilation like Java. The important learning I had was doing the login. It was pretty simple and easy to understand. Another one was how to use async, functions, constructors on the website. 


Startup Project notes:

My first learning for this assignment is to have patience. While I had so many ideas to implement in my portfolio, I had to choose the things that makes my project work better.
1. I struggled with JS functions in this project.I got a good practice on addEventListener() for switching the colors in the portfolio.
2. Making sure I name my classes that make sense. Which eventually helped to style the class and use it in JS. 
3. This time I used the "inspect" option on the website to make changes idententations. That was pretty cool.
4. I learned that I can hide style switcher on scroll. Which means when I click the settings button, the colors pop out and when I scroll down the page the colors pop hides. I was able to do this using window.addEventListener() 
5. I learned that document and window are different objects and they some different events. Using addEventListener() on them listens to events destined for a different object. Like, there is a "resize" event on the window object that is not on the document object.

Simon Webservice Notes:
As i followed the steps to convert Simon to a service. I learned how every thing fell in place like in order. Step one was to move all my files to sub folder so I can use Node.js based service to host the front-end application files. I learned that static file middleware takes care of reading front-end code from public directory and returns it to browser. Then was to make changes in my about.html and about.js to display the random quotes. Updating the scores.js file to the latest high scores from the service. I learned to use localStorage object to store the scores in case the user goes offline.
After that part was to run commands to configure the directory to work with node.js. Installing Express to create dependency on json files and createing index.js which is the root of the project to run my app in web service. 
Overall it was neat to use the debugger/breakpoint to check how my code is working. 


Simon DB Notes:
I learned how to data is stored in MongoDB and the highest scores reflecting on the list. I used mySQL before for another assignement but MongoDB is easy as it has no strict schema requirements. Each document that is updated in the collection alonst followed similar schema. The connection code to MongoDB was also striaghtforward. With the client connection I was able to get a database object and from that a collection object. The insertOne function was interesting as this method can also throw either writeError or writeConcernError exception and also be used inside multi-document transactions. By calling the   insertOne method an collection object I was able to pass the JavaScript object. I have also learned that when a document is inserted into the collection it will automatically be assigned a unique ID. Reading the credentials from environment variables for the connection string is also useful.So, I do not have to share my actual credentials.
